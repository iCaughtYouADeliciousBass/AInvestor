    # Jason code goes here
    # Import libs you need, return a LIST of useful stocks to monitor.  This should include a list of all
    # currently owned / monitored stocks.  Use MySQL Workbench to look at the currently owned stocks.
    # Create a table (SM_stocks for example, where SM is Stock Manager), and populate this with currently owned stocks
    # OR use the Alpaca API to get the currently owned / monitored stocks
    # How you find what is 'useful' is up to you.  You could trawl stock trading websites for high variance
    # or high changes or high volume.  The expectation is to do some form of web trawling with the capability
    # of being used via multiprocessing.  This means it should be encompassed by some form of loop that can be
    # made in parallel.
