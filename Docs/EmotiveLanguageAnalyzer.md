## Emotive Language Analyzer
The goal for the ELA is to parse useful websites for emotive language.  Since most of conversation is made up of body language, I believe the same is for written and emotive language.  Since other processes within the project consist of what I will refer to is 'hard' information - statistics and numbers - it is important to take into account the emotional response or feeling of the market or the public.  In the same way you can't use logic to argue emotion and vice versa, you cannot use hard information to predict soft information.  


### Responsibilities
* Parse adaptive website list for emotive language
* Manage an emotive language reference library (Possibly tie into Machine Learning component)
* 



### Outputs
* A Market Confidence and Result Confidence (100% confident stock is going to 0)
