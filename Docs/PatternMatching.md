The goal for the PM is to graphically superimpose current trends with historical trends and comparable stock trends, for example comparing high risk assets against eachother to see if there is a general trend for high risk assets.  This could be offloaded to the ML component.

* With graphs generated by the Data Processing Module, compare the graphs visually for trends through time / commonalities

* A Numeric ?variable? of Consistency - this could be an array or matrix
